Create a responsive "Play Together" Page for a web-based music game called "MelodyPlay" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Without any react, tailwand or any other framework
Follow a clean, minimal, Apple-style design.
Write the code to link to this code and match them exactly:

Requirements:

1.	Main section layout:
Title: "Play Together" (centered, large, bold).
Subtitle: "Invite friends or join a lobby to start playing."

2.	Friends List Panel:
A clean card/list view showing friend placeholders (username + small avatar).
Each friend card should have an "Invite" button (rounded, minimal).
Option at the bottom: "Add Friend" (button or + icon).

3.	Lobby Section:
Two buttons: "Create Room" and "Join Room".
"Create Room" opens a modal popup asking for room name and settings (e.g., number of players).
"Join Room" opens a modal popup asking for Room Code.
Both modals should have Cancel and Confirm buttons.

4.	Modal Popups:
Styled with rounded corners, shadows, and centered.
Simple, minimal input fields with labels.

5.	JavaScript:
Handle modal open/close for Create Room and Join Room.
Handle click on "Invite" buttons (placeholder function).
Handle "Add Friend" click (placeholder function).

6.	Styling:
Use light background, soft shadows, rounded corners.
Font: clean and modern (system-ui or SF Pro style).
Buttons should have hover effects (slight shadow or scale).
Consistent with the Home page design.

7.	Footer (minimal): "Â© 2025 MelodyPlay"
